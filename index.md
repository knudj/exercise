# Luna Lovegood

Luna Lovegood is a fictional character in the Harry Potter books written by J. K. Rowling. She was sorted in the House of Ravenclaw and first appears in the movies and the books in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.

Luna Lovegood was born on the 13th of February 1981. She is the daughter of Xenophilius Lovegood and Pandora Lovegood, and lives near the Weasley's house, in a rook-like house in Devon. Her mother accidently died while experimenting with spells when Luna was nine. She was then raised by her father, editor of the magazine 'The Quibbler'. She attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1992-1999. Many people in the Harry Potter series think she is a strange girl. This has led to her having the nickname "Loony Lovegood", but she does not change herself. She was in her first year at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Harry Potter's second year Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and was in her fourth year when she first came into the series.
